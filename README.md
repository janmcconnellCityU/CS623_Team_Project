# DS623 Team Project

This project explores the mathematical and statistical principles underlying core image processing techniques. It focuses on the use of matrix operations to extract meaningful features from visual data. Using only NumPy and Pandas, we implement and analyze key methods such as convolution, edge detection, filtering, and dimensionality reduction. These operations form the foundation for more advanced models in computer vision, such as convolutional neural networks, but are implemented here without reliance on high-level machine learning frameworks. The project emphasizes a hands-on, mathematical approach to understanding how machines interpret images, combining theory with practical experimentation on real visual data.
